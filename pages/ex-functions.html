        <h1>Functions Exercises</h1>
        <p>There are several exercises being doing here using <code>prompt</code> and <code>alert</code>. So I recommedn to refresh this webpage to get a better hang of them. Naturally, I am not writing so much because everything is on the comments.</p>
        <p>In the future, I hope to add several buttons and expressions to explain exercise in more details.</p>
